    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll need to register for both:</p>

  <li>Self Assessment</li>
  <li>Class 2 National Insurance</li>

<p class="govuk-body">
  <a href="#" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">Register through your tax account</a>
.</p>

<p>You’ll need a Government Gateway user ID and password to sign in. If you do not have a user ID, you’ll be able to create one.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to register</h2>
<p>You must tell HMRC by 5 October if you need to send a tax return and you have not sent one before. You could be fined if you do not.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you cannot register online</h2>
<p>Register for Self Assessment and Class 2 National Insurance by <a href="https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/forms.html?contentRoot=repository:///Applications/NICs_iForms/1.0/CWF1_20167&template=CWF1.xdp"> in the form online </a>. Print and post it to HMRC.</p>
<p>You’ll need to have all your information ready as you cannot save a partly completed form.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
<p>You’ll get your Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) by post in 15 working days (21 days if you’re abroad). You’ll get it sooner in your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/download-the-hmrc-app"> HMRC app </a>.

  HMRC will contact you by email or post telling you to complete a Self Assessment tax return before it’s due.
